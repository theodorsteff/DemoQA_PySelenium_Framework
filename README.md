# QA Automation Framework Demo
## Selenium with Python integration

**Demo Project:** *Selenium testing framework implementation with Python*  
**Showcase implementation by:** *Theodor-Stefan Baca*  
**Dependency packages installed:** **_pytest_ and _selenium_** *(including their automatically installed dependencies)*  
**Credits:** *The demo page used is provided by SeleniumBase (https://seleniumbase.io/demo_page)*

The project uses a virtual environment with the required packages already installed. This should not require any further installations on the client machine, as long as the virtual environment is being activated. However, in case there is an issue with using the virtual environment, or a local installation for the packages is preferred, please follow the *pip install* command structure, as showcased below.

### pytest
`» pip install pytest`

### selenium
`» pip install selenium`  

For test suite execution, please use the pytest syntax, as shown below ("--html report.html" will generate a test report in the same folder as the location of the testcases)  
`» py.test --html report.html` 

**Python version used:** *Python 3.11.0*  
**Selenium library version used:** *selenium 4.10.0*  
**Pytest library version used:** *Python 7.3.1*
