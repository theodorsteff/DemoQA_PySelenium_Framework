# QA Automation Framework Demo
## Selenium with Python integration

**Demo Project:** *Selenium testing framework implementation with Python*  
**Showcase implementation by:** *Theodor-Stefan Baca*  
**Dependency packages installed:** **_pytest_ and _selenium_** *(including their automatically installed dependencies)*  

The project uses a virtual environment with the required packages already installed. This should not require any further installations on the client machine, as long as the virtual environment is being activated. However, in case there is an issue with using the virtual environment, or a local installation for the packages is preferred, please follow the *pip install* command structure, as showcased below.

### pytest
`» pip install pytest`

### selenium
`» pip install selenium`

**Python version used:** *Python 3.11*
